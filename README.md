---

## 1. Title & Purpose  
**Decision Support Report for Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse – Actionable Recommendations with Ethical and Reliability Analysis**  

---

## 2. Executive Summary (≤ 300 words)  
This report builds on prior LLM-generated insights and synthetic interviews to provide actionable, stakeholder-facing recommendations for the Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse program.  

**Tiered Recommendations:**  
- **Operational (Low Risk):** Targeted late-game endurance drills; build offensive sets around Emma Ward.  
- **Investigatory (Medium Risk):** Monitor fatigue levels and turnover patterns using controlled trials and additional data collection.  
- **High Stakes (High Risk):** Any roster or personnel changes should undergo ethical and legal review.  

**Confidence Statement:** Findings are reproducible from descriptive stats. Confidence is *moderate* due to missing contextual data such as injuries or detailed play-by-play.  

---

## 3. Background & Decision Context  
- **Stakeholders:** Coach, athletic director, team staff.  
- **Decision:** How to prioritize training, strategy, and player development.  
- **Risk Level:** Medium – affects both player well-being and competitive outcomes.  

---

## 4. Data & Methods  
- **Data Provenance:** SU Women’s Lacrosse team statistics (collected by athletics staff).  
- **Inputs:**  
  - Task 05 LLM prompts and outputs (`llm_prompts.md`).  
  - Task 06 synthetic interview process (`README_process.md`) and transcript (`transcript.txt`).  
- **Validation Steps:** Descriptive stats reproduction, reproducibility checks, and seed logging for transparency.  

---

## 5. Findings  
- **Strategy:** Offense prioritized over defense.  
- **Key Player:** Emma Ward = offensive efficiency leader & game-changer.  
- **Improved Player:** Joely Caramelli = most improved contributor.  
- **Fatigue:** Scoring dropped from 74 goals (Q1) to 47 goals (Q4).  
- **Neutral-Site:** No impact (no neutral-site games played).  
- **Next Steps:** Recreate visuals from Task 05 data (goals by period, efficiency plots).  

---

## 6. Recommendations (Tiered)  
- **Operational (Low Risk):** Late-game endurance training; offensive focus around Emma Ward.  
- **Investigatory (Medium Risk):** Collect turnover and fatigue data; run controlled trials.  
- **High Stakes (High Risk):** Personnel or roster decisions only after HR/legal review.  

---

## 7. Ethical & Legal Considerations  
- **Bias:** Ensure balanced evaluation across players (not just star athletes).  
- **Privacy:** Public stats only; protect personal/health data if collected.  
- **Transparency:** All AI-generated content clearly labeled as synthetic (`README_process.md`).  

---

## 8. Next Steps & Validation  
- Collect remaining 2025 season data.  
- Run bootstrap simulations to quantify uncertainty.  
- Stress-test recommendations with sensitivity analyses.  
- Validate training adjustments through controlled scrimmages.
